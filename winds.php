            <p>
                The wind starts to blow after the cold front and blows from the north. Tramontana is transitional in
                nature and most commonly develops into the Bora. Tramontana starts blowing suddenly and can reach
                the power of a hurricane. It is usually an indicator that extreme weather conditions will follow.
                It usually lasts for a day and can be quite unpredictable and shifty, generating large waves.
                Sailboats are not recommended to sail in such a wind as it can reach up to 200km/h.

                Burin is a coastal wind and is caused by differences in temperature between the sea and the land.
                It is a thermal wind that usually blows during the evenings and night hours, when the land is colder
                than the sea and the wind equalizes the difference. Burin blows in the almost the same direction as
                the Bura, but at a much more pleasant force.

                The wind blowing in gusts, usually from the northeast. When this high-pressure wind comes tumbling
                down towards the sea from the mountains, it gains momentum, often reaching gusts of 80 knots.
                It is certainly the coldest and the most powerful wind. The strength of the Bora weakens as we move
                away from the shore. It's causing rough seas and it's breaking waves. Bura blows a cold wind under
                sunny skies often lasting for several days - in the winter it can last for several weeks, but it
                can also last for only an hour in the summer.

            </div>
            <p>
                Levanat is a moderate traditional wind that, in wintertime, occurs when Jugo turns to Bura and in
                summertime, it is a breeze in the morning that turns into the favorable Maestral. Levanat is most prone
                to blow for a couple of days in a row from February to March bringing clouds and rainfall.
                Levanat brings good sailing conditions although it is not so popular as it is usually a very cold wind.

            <p>
                Jugo is warm and humid wind that brings changeable weather, usually precipitation as well. Compared to
                Bura, it blows more evenly, and like Bura, it shakes the sea strongly. It causes high and choppy waves,
                with showers in between. It is a long-lasting wind as it can blow from six to nine days, and at
                intervals up to three weeks.

            <p>
                It is a short-lived transit wind that blows from south to north. It is a warm and humid wind that often
                carries rain, but it is also sometimes identified with Lebić and Jugo. In summer, it can only blow for
                a few hours.

            </div>
            <p>
                Lebić blows from the southwest and causes big waves and rough seas. Due to the shape of the Adriatic
                bay, the wind quickly changes direction. The powerful Lebić usually brings high-tide, abundant rain,
                and wild waves and is known to destroy many south facing beaches and coastlines. It is formed during
                storms in the summer or when an anticyclone arrives from the southwest. It sometimes comes after Jugo
                or after the passing of a cyclone and tends to last a few hours only.

            <p>
                Pulenat is a rare and unfriendly wind, more popular in the northern Adriatic, and you can foresee it
                coming, as it takes form in very unusual phases. At first, the sea and wind would be almost at a
                stand-still, then clouds form from the west, followed by gusts, and then once again there is the
                “quiet before the storm”, before Pulenat pays a visit with high waves and extremely dangerous
                conditions, particularly in longitudinal channels. A powerful Punenat tends to creates havoc on west
                facing beaches and promenades. It is short-lived and can blow at any time of the year.

            </div>
            <p>
                Maestral is a pleasant coastal wind that blows from north to south. The wind starts to blow in the
                morning between 9.00 and 10.00, and intensifies until 14.00, when it reaches its maximum strength.
                In case the Maestral does not blow for several hours in the evening, it means that the weather
                will be bad. Maestral blows during the summertime and can at times reach up to 30 knots.

                The wind rose is a graphical representation used by meteorologists to display constant winds for a
                specific area. A certain wind, represented in a wind rose, <strong>blows in the direction towards
                the center</strong> of the rose. For an example, Tramontana on the Adriatic wind rose, blows from
                North to South.
